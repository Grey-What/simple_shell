# Simple Shell

A simple shell is a program that provides an interface for the user to interact with the operating system. It allows the user to enter commands, which are then executed by the shell or passed to the kernel. A simple shell can also run scripts, which are files that contain a sequence of commands.

The purpose of a simple shell is to make it easier for the user to perform tasks on the system, without having to know the low-level details of how the system works. A simple shell can also automate repetitive or complex operations, by using variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions.

### Some of the uses of a simple shell are:

- Managing files and directories
- Running programs and processes
- Controlling input and output
- Performing text processing and manipulation
- Accessing network resources
- Debugging and testing

### A simple shell works by following these steps:

- It prints a prompt, which indicates that it is ready to accept input from the user.
- It reads the input from the user, either from the keyboard or from a file.
- It parses the input into tokens, which are the basic units of a command, such as words, symbols, or operators.
- It evaluates the tokens, and determines if they are built-in commands, external commands, or syntax errors.
- If the tokens are built-in commands, the shell executes them directly, without invoking any other program.
- If the tokens are external commands, the shell forks a child process, and executes the command in the child process, using the execv system call.
- If the tokens are syntax errors, the shell prints an error message, and returns to the prompt.
- The shell waits for the child process to finish, and then returns the exit status of the command to the user.

### Some of the benefits of using a simple shell are:

- It is portable, meaning that it can run on different operating systems and platforms, as long as they have a compatible shell interpreter.
- It is flexible, meaning that it can be customized and extended by the user, using aliases, functions, variables, and environment settings.
- It is powerful, meaning that it can perform complex tasks with a few simple commands, using pipes, redirection, wildcards, and expansion.
- It is interactive, meaning that it can respond to the user's input dynamically, and provide feedback and error handling.

A simple shell is made by writing a program in a programming language, such as C, that implements the functionality of a shell. The program typically consists of the following components:

- A main function, that initializes the shell, and enters an infinite loop of reading, parsing, and executing commands.
- A read function, that reads the input from the user, and stores it in a buffer.
- A parse function, that splits the input into tokens, and stores them in an array.
- An execute function, that evaluates the tokens, and performs the appropriate action, depending on the type of command.
- A built-in function, that implements the functionality of a built-in command, such as cd, exit, or echo.
- A fork function, that creates a child process, and executes the external command in the child process.
- A wait function, that waits for the child process to finish, and returns the exit status of the command.
- A signal handler, that handles the signals sent by the operating system, such as SIGINT, SIGQUIT, or SIGCHLD.
